## Prediction of Goodreads' Ratings and Decipher User Interactions Using Linear Regression:

Goodreads is the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations. Goodreads introduces a lot of new social interactions related for its users. But how many 
of them are relevant to the average Goodreads user?

### The goal of this project is to:

1. Scrape data from goodreads.com
2. Understand the factors that makes a better Goodreads user interactions.
3. Predict book ratings 

### Tools required:

I’m leaving the option open to scale my tool use as needed. But for now, These are the minimum requirements:

1. Beautifulsoup and selenium for Web scraping
2. Pandas, Numpy for EDA
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for Visualization
4. Scikit-learn for Linear regression 

### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

Goodreads team, Book publishers can put greater emphasis on the sections that would drive more readers towards their books.

### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

I plan to collect data using Beautiful soup and Selenium from goodreads.com and convert it into a dataframe for further analysis and modeling.

### What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
 Features: Title, Author, Average rating, Ratings, Genre, Binding, Followers, Trivia, Quote Likes, Amazon Price, Published Date, Number of Pages.
 
### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

A model that can predict book ratings close to the actual ones would be a minimum viable product.
